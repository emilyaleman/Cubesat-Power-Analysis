# Cubesat-Power-Analysis

This repository includes a preliminary power analysis software model for Cubesats. It spans both keplerian and non keplerian orbits, dimensions up to 6U, estimates the sun's position based on orbital geometry, calculates total and average power per panel and has been compared against GMAT to test for similar results. Any recommendations or suggestions to improve this model are welcomed. A streamlit-powered interface is also provided for the platform.
